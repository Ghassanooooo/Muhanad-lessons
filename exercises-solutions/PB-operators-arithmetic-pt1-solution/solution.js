//0. Declare two variables "snackServings" and "guests" and assign them number values.

const snackServings = 20;
const guests = 30;

//1. Add snackServings and guests, and print the result to the console.

console.log(snackServings + guests);

//2. Subtract guests from snackServings, and print the result to the console. Then, subtract snackServings from guests and print the result to the console.

console.log(snackServings - guests);
console.log(guests - snackServings);

//3. Multiply snackServings and guests, and print the result to the console.

console.log(snackServings * guests);

//4. Divide snackServings and guests, and print the result to the console.

console.log(snackServings/guests);

//5. Declare another variable "drinks" with the value "10". Multiply snackServings and guests. Then, divide the result by drinks. Store the result in a new variable named "resultOne".

const drinks = 10;
const resultOne = (snackServings * guests) / drinks;

//6. Declare two variables "monkeys" with the value of 15 and "bananas" with the value of 9. Print the remainder when monkeys is divided by bananas.

//7. Declare another variable "monkeyfights" with the value of 20. Add monkeys and bananas, then multiply the result by monkeyfights. Store the result in variable "resultTwo". Print "resultTwo" to the console.

//8. Increment monkeys. Print the result to the console.

//9. Decrement bananas. Print the result to the console.result

console.log(--bananas);

//10. Subtract bananas from monkeys and store this in a new variable "happiness". Add happiness and monkeyfights.

const happiness = monkeys - bananas;

//11. Print the remainder when resultOne is divided by resultTwo to the console.

console.log(resultOne % resultTwo);
